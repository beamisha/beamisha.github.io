						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<br/>
						<p align="left">
						Having completed my coursework at Queens University in Fall 2022, I have now applied to graduate with
						a Bachelor of Computing. My specialization in cognitive science has allowed me to take a series of courses
						in psychology and philosophy, in addition to the core computer science courses that all computing students
						take. I cherish the time I have spent learning from professors and peers, and helping others learn as a teaching
						assistant for several undergraduate courses.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p align="left">
						Outside of computer science, I have a strong interest in music, and guitar in particular. I have recently
						started to perform in open mics at local establishmnets, and plan to perform and record more
						music in the future. As I start uploading audio and video of my music to the internet, I will link to it
						from this website. 
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p align="left">
						My career ambitions are very much alligned with my interests and abilities. Over the course of my degree, i have acquired 
						skills and knowledge in software development, artificial intelligence, and research practices. Through my work experience,
						I have also learned a lot about business, and sales in particular. I am currently applying to several masters programs in 
						music technology, because I want to combine my love of music with my passion and skills in computer science. I am also 
						looking for immediate full-time emplyoyement, in a role that develops my professional skills in the areas of
						software developement, business and customer service, audio recording and production, or ideally all of these areas.
						</p>
