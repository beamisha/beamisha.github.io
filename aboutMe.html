						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<br/>
						<p align="left">
						After having completed my coursework at Queens University in Fall 2022, I have now officially graduated with a Bachelor of Computing! My specialization in cognitive science has allowed me to take a series of courses
						in psychology and philosophy, in addition to the core computer science courses. I am very grateful to all those who
						have supported me on my educational journey, most of all my parents.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p align="left">
						My long-term career ambitions are very much alligned with my interests and abilities. Over the course of my degree, I have
						not only acquired technical skills in software development and artificial intelligence, but have seen personal growth through my diverse experiences and extracurricular involvement. Through my work experience,
						I have also learned valuable business skills that will be useful as I begin the next chapter of my life as a professional.
						</p>
