						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<br/>
						<p align="left">
						Hi there! I’m Alex, a problem solver, innovator, entrepreneur and software developer from Kingston, Ontario, with a passion for digital product creation and UX design. Through my experience in the technology industry and my undergraduate studies at Queen's University, I’ve been able to pursue my passion for creating amazing digital experiences and solutions that make an impact.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p align="left">
						In my professional career, I’ve had the pleasure of working with several Ontario-based companies, where I helped design and implement new digital products and systems. Whether I'm conducting user research, creating mockups or writing code, I strive to approach my work with a holistic, human-centered perspective that's rooted in empathy.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p align="left">
						Outside of work, you can sometimes find me enjoying the outdoors or playing guitar. I strive to live mindfully, and am passionate about self-care and self improvement through practices such as meditation and exercise.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p>
						I always look forward to connecting with new people! To get in touch, you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-beamish-b00510156/">LinkedIn</a>, or email me at beamish.alex@gmail.com.
