						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<br/>
						<p align="left">
						Having completed my coursework at Queens University in Fall 2022, I have now applied to graduate with
						a Bachelor of Computing. My specialization in cognitive science has allowed me to take a series of courses
						in psychology and philosophy, in addition to the core computer science courses. I cherish the time I have spent learning from professors and peers, and helping others learn as a teaching
						assistant for several undergraduate courses.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p align="left">
						In 2022, I began working with The CINDER Project (formerly BEAR), a student-led initiative focused on developing software that serves BIPOC businesses and communities.
						This work eventually led myself and Neila Toofuny to found a development agency called Codempowr (www.codempowr.com), which continues the work of The CINDER Project as part of
						it's core mission.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<p align="left">
						My long-term career ambitions are very much alligned with my interests and abilities. Over the course of my degree, I have acquired 
						skills and knowledge in software development, artificial intelligence, and research practices. Through my work experience,
						I have also learned about various aspects of business development and sales. In the near future, I am focused on doing excellent development
						work with our team at Codempowr, and growing our portfolio.
						</p>
