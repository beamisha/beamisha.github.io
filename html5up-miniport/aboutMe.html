						<h2>About Me</h2>
                        <br/>
						<p>I am a 23 year old aspiring software developer from Kingston, Ontario. I will be graduating from Queen's University this January, 
                            and am currently looking to pursue my passion of software development and data science with a full-time role in this area. My 
                            program of study at Queen's (Bachelor of Computing, cognitive science specialization) has allowed me to take a range of courses not
                            only in computer science, but also in philosophy and psychology, and to learn about artificial intelligence from many different perspectives.
                            I hope that my passion for this field is conveyed through the projects on this portfolio website. In my spare time, you can find me playing guitar, juggling, or 
                            just hanging out with friends and family.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
